2D Lighting Demo
=============

This is a 2D dynamic lighting demo, created using [LWJGL](http://www.lwjgl.org/), and uses [BMFont](http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/) for fonts.

This is just an upload of the project found [here](http://eat.sleep.build/Projects/LightingDemo/) so that it is easier to browse.

You can download a playable version on the [project page](http://eat.sleep.build/Projects/LightingDemo/), or directly [here](http://eat.sleep.build/files/2DShadows.zip).

Building the game
-----------------
This was made using eclipse, and I am not very familiar with java's command line tools, so there is no automated build process provided.
